# ABOUT
Imagiconv is a simple image converter for cli.

Supported formats:
 - jpg
 - png
 - gif
# INSTALLATION
We will be compiling the project from source.
For newcomers that means you will need `git` and golang compiler(see [go.dev](https://go.dev/dl)). There are a lot of tutorials for that.
## windows, mac and linux non-packaged
1. Install the project: `go install github.com/marekor555/imagiconv`
2. Now try the app: `imagiconv convertme.jpg png` this command converts jpg to png

If the above command fails, saying that getgo command is not found. 
You need to add go bin to path. And try again.
